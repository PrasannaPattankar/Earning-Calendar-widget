# Earning-Calendar-widget
This project is a React-based Earnings Calendar Widget that integrates with the Benzinga API to fetch earnings reports and company logos. The UI structures earnings data by weekdays (Monday-Friday), displaying "Before Open" and "After Close" earnings for each day. Clicking a company's logo redirects users to its Benzinga quote page.
